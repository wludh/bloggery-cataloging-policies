"Accession numbers will be formed by first using the year of receipt or if the year of receipt is unknown, by using the current year.¬† This will be followed by a dash and four digits, beginning with 0001.¬† Use consecutive numbering for each additional accession within a single year.<br /><br /><em>In an ArchivesSpace accession record</em>,¬†<em>this autopopulates because of a plugin</em>.¬† If you begin a new accession record but do not save it, the next accession record you create will go to the next number as if you had saved it.¬† Therefore, one cannot assume at the end of a year that the second part of the accession number corresponds perfectly with the number of accessions received that year."
