"[child-pages depth=3]<br /><br />&nbsp;"<br />"<h1><strong>Terminology for </strong><strong>Naming Collections</strong></h1><br />We will name our archival collections in accordance with DACS and the SAA glossary of Archival Terms.<br /><h3 align="LEFT">Applicable DACS Rules</h3><br /><p align="LEFT">2.3.3</p><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">When devising title information, compose a brief title </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">that uniquely identifies the </span>material, normally consisting of a name segment, a term indicating the nature of the unit being described, <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">and optionally a topical segment as instructed in the following rules.¬† </span>Do not enclose devised titles in square brackets.<br /><p align="LEFT">2.3.5</p><br /><p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Record the name(s) in the form by which the creator or collector is generally </span>known.¬† <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Record the name(s) in the natural language order of the language of the </span>person‚Äôs or corporate body‚Äôs country of residence or activity or the official language of the corporate body.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">Examples: We are calling it the O. W. Riegel Collection instead of the Oscar Wetherhold Collection since O. W. is how the creator was generally known.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">2.3.19</p><br /><p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Archival materials are frequently described by devised aggregate terms such as </span><em>papers</em> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">(for personal materials), </span><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">records </span></i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">(for organizational materials), or </span><i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">collection </span></i><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">(for </span>topical aggregations). However, other terms are also used. The term(s) used to describe the nature of archival materials should be comprehensible to the institution‚Äôs patrons. Titles should be constructed in a coherent and consistent format according to the rules of the individual institution.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">Please see the SAA definitions for these and related terms below.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">2.3.20</p><br /><p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Where the materials being described consist solely of one or two specific forms, </span>supply those form(s) <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">for the nature of the archival unit. Express the forms in their order </span>of predominance.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">Example: Coll. 0061 Benjamin Franklin Doswell Correspondence contains 7 letters written by Doswell while he was a student at W&amp;L.¬† Since the collection contains only one kind of item, we are calling this Correspondence instead of Papers.</p><br /><p align="LEFT">2.3.22</p><br /><p align="LEFT"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Optionally, devise a brief term or phrase that most precisely and concisely </span>characterizes the unit being described. The term or phrase should incorporate the form(s) of material that typifies the unit and reflects the function, activity, transaction, subject, individuals, or organizations that were the basis of its creation or use.</p><br /><br /><h2>Definitions from the SAA glossary</h2><br /><strong>Papers</strong>- A collection of personal or family documents; personal papers.<br /><br /><strong>Records</strong>- ¬†A written or printed work of a legal or official nature that may be used as<br />evidence or proof; a document.<br /><br /><strong>Collection</strong>- Materials assembled by a person, organization, or repository from a variety of sources; an artificial collection.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;"
