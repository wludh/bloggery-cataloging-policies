"<h2>What is it?</h2><br />Faceted Access to Subject Terminology or "FAST headings" are subject headings derived from the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). While LCSH often contain one or more subdivisions, FAST headings are designed to break those subdivisions apart into separate headings. Catalogers follow certain rules to construct subject headings with subdivisions, but FAST headings eliminates the need for that construction. Each term is "authorized" and has an ID number, similar to the way that each person or corporate authority record has a number.<br /><br />There are eight facets in FAST: chronological, corporate names, events, form/genre, geographic names, personal names, titles, and topics. This means that there will usually be more FAST headings than LCSH because headings with subdivisions have been broken up into individual pieces.<br /><h2>What does FAST look like?</h2><br />Traditional LCSH:<br />600 $aWashington, George, $d 1732-1799<br />650 $aTrenton, Battle of, Trenton, N.J., 1776 $v Juvenile literature.<br />651 $aDelaware River (N.Y.-Del. and N.J.).<br /><br />FAST:<br />600 17 $a Washington, George, $d 1732-1799 $2 fast<br />611 7 $a Trenton, Battle of (New Jersey : 1776) $2 fast<br />648 7 $a 1776 $2 fast<br />651 7 $a New Jersey $z Trenton $2 fast<br />651 7 $a United States $z Delaware River $2 fast<br />655 7 $a Juvenile works $2 fast<br /><br /><b>The best way to identify FAST is by the second indicator of 7 and the subfield $2 fast.</b> <a href="http://annie.wlu.edu/record=b2065624%7ES0">This is an example of what they look like in the catalog. </a><br /><h2>Where do I see FAST?</h2><br />OCLC has been systematically adding FAST headings to most records in OCLC. They will appear on new AND old records. We have configured the load tables to allow FAST headings to enter Millennium. Unfortunately, they're not indexing very well in Annie. We have a ticket out to fix this.<br /><br />FAST headings are also being used in ArchivesSpace and the Digital Repository.<br /><h2>What does this mean for me?</h2><br />You will need to watch out for "messy" headings that try to sneak in the open door that we've created for FAST. Because of the way Millennium is set up right now, we are letting in any 6xx field with a second indicator of 7 enter Millennium from OCLC. As part of the cleanup you do to a record before you export it into Millennium, you will need to look for and remove 6xx fields that have a subfield $2 of anything that is NOT FAST. There is a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/sourcelist/subject.html">long list</a> of what these other codes could be, but you will encounter them most often on records that have been edited by non-American agencies or libraries.<br /><h2>Why FAST?</h2><br />Although we're still investigating FAST headings, there are several potential benefits:<br /><ul><br />	<li>FAST headings are easier to apply than LCSH, especially for less experienced catalogers.</li><br />	<li>FAST headings are available as "linked data," meaning they can participate in a large network of linked authority records. Using them now helps us anticipate the future of resource description.</li><br />	<li>FAST headings, because they're more like keywords, will operate well in a discovery service environment.</li><br />	<li>FAST headings can be loaded in bulk into ArchivesSpace.</li><br />	<li>There is an API that can be used to tie FAST into other systems</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Where can I learn more?</h2><br /><ul><br />	<li><a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/fast.html?urlm=159754">OCLC FAST Home</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://oclc.org/content/dam/support/worldcat/records/faceted-application-of-subject-terminology.pdf">OCLC Intro to FAST pdf</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://fast.oclc.org/searchfast/">SearchFAST</a></li><br />	<li><a href="http://experimental.worldcat.org/fast/assignfast/">AssignFAST</a></li><br /></ul>"
