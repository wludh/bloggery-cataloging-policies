<p align="center">Leyburn Library Vault Cleanup Projects</p>
I. Manuscript Collections

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Answer questions about cataloged archival collections</span>

<b>Timeframe:</b> Now so that Mackenzie can have all catalog records ingested into ArchivesSpace before Emily undertakes the Mss 100 project.

1. Spec Coll staff review document from Alston that outlines questions related to cataloged archival collections

2. Send answers back to Alston

3. She makes needed changes to catalog record

4. Mackenzie imports the updated catalog records into ArchivesSpace
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Mss 100</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Timeframe:</b> Alston and Emily Crawford will start this at the very beginning of June as soon as Emily returns after graduation

&nbsp;

<b>Extent:</b> 3 Hollinger boxes

&nbsp;

1. Alston works with Emily Crawford to take an inventory of all items in Mss 100

&nbsp;

<b>i.</b> Pull a box from the vault and take to overflow researcher table

&nbsp;

<b>ii.</b> While going through the box, for each item or set of items that need to be its own collection, create a resource record for that collection in ArchivesSpace. ¬†Assign it a collection title and number.

&nbsp;

***Note on photocopies:

If what would be a whole collection consists of only one photocopy, pull the folder aside instead of assigning it as collection name and number.¬† Share any items you pull out with Alston, who will consult with Tom

If photocopies are present within a collection, note their presence in the resource record.

&nbsp;

**** If multiple collections are sharing a hollinger box, make a note of this in the resource records for all collections

&nbsp;

<b>iii.</b> relabel the folders with new collection name, add coll number, check location before moving onto the next new collection

2. Physically relabel all boxes

&nbsp;

3. Cricket will modify the catalog records for five existing MSS 100 catalog records

&nbsp;

4. Over time, Alston and Mackenzie will generate MarcXML from the ArchivesSpace resource records as they are finished and will load this MarcXML into Millennium to create catalog records.

<b>ii.</b> While going through the box, for each item or set of items that need to be its own collection, create a resource record for that collection in ArchivesSpace.¬† Assign it a collection title and number.¬† For larger collections, resist the temptation to begin processing the collection thoroughly and instead record only the most important information in the resource record.

&nbsp;

<i>***Note on photocopies:</i>

If what would be a whole collection consists of only one photocopy, pull the folder aside instead of assigning it as collection name and number.¬† Share any items you pull out with Alston, who will consult with Tom

<b>iii.</b> relabel folders with new collection name, add coll number before moving onto the next new collection

&nbsp;

2. physically relabel all boxes

&nbsp;

3. Over time, Alston and Mackenzie will generate MarcXML from the ArchivesSpace resource records as they are finished and will load this MarcXML into Millennium to create catalog records.

II. University Archives

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Reclassing Dewey items to Record Groups</span>

<b>Timeframe:</b>

start now with smaller ones that have already come up in other work: FOLios, Library Letters

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">i. Boxed publications</span>

46 titles on Spreadsheet C

&nbsp;

The steps below are a generalized workflow for these publications.¬† Individual titles may need to have other actions taken.¬† The details of each title will be worked out before that title is reclassed.

1. determine which record group each Dewey title should be transferred to

&nbsp;

2. relabel folders

&nbsp;

3. write new Record Group number on the items in pencil above where the Dewey number is written

&nbsp;

4. relabel the boxes with RG # and name of publication

&nbsp;

5. physical location:

place each title as it is reclassed and relabeled back in its current location and then move all publications to their new Record Group locations after all have been reclassed.

&nbsp;

6. call number will need to be updated in the catalog record for each one of these publications

&nbsp;

7. an item record will be created for each box and a barcode applied to the box lid on the same end as a labels

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">ii. Uncataloged Boxed publications</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">¬†</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">iii. Bound publications</span>

9 titles on Spreadsheet D

&nbsp;

1. determine which record group each Dewey title should be transferred to

&nbsp;

2. some have call numbers on their spines which we might want to relabel

&nbsp;

3. write new Record Group number above the Dewey number written on the piece

&nbsp;

4. update call number in bib records and add a note about when the reclass occurred

&nbsp;

5. For items where the barcode is attached to an acid free flag, either relabel flag in pencil OR generate new flag and give item new barcode.

&nbsp;

6. Physical location: I recommend we wait till all are reclassed to move them physically.¬† For some we might want to relabel ends of rows instead of moving them physically.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EXAMPLE:

Calyx weeding

&nbsp;

1. I go through the ones in the vault and uses Wendy‚Äôs documents to help me decide which copies to withdraw, leaving best condition copies on the shelf; pull volumes to be withdrawn

2. Tom reviews my selections and adjusts as needed

3. I also pull volumes that need to have their copy numbers updated, paper clipping a note with the NEW copy number to the flag

&nbsp;

4. I pass these volumes on to Tony

&nbsp;

5. Tony withdraws the volumes in millennium (deleting item records) and physically deprocesses them

6. Tony notifies Alston and Mackenzie when he has completed this work; they get him started on vols that need item number updates.

7. For those, in Millennium Tony updates their copy numbers and replaces the 082 Dewey call number in the item records with an 099 that says "Record Group 47".

8. He can either cross through the Dewey call number and copy # on the acid free flags and write the new info

OR he can type a new acid free flag (which will mean the item will need a new barcode).

&nbsp;

9. Tony notifies Mackenzie and Alston when he has completed this work

10. Alston brings the updated volumes back to the vault and in collaboration with spec coll staff reshelve them into a smaller area

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">iv. Publications split between boxed and bound</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">¬†</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline">v. Law Titles in Dewey</span>

6 titles on Spreadsheet E

Do we want to keep these titles at all?

Alston spoke with John Jacob.¬† He is actively collecting all of these titles.¬† He would be willing to take on sole responsibility for collecting these materials and would also want any items we withdraw to fill in gaps in his own collection

<span style="text-decoration: underline">vi. Honors Theses</span>

Approximately 1300 in vault

1. Update spine label?

2. write new Record Group number in pencil on the items above Dewey number?

3. We can update the call numbers in batch edit in Millennium from the dewey numbers in bib record 082 to 099 Record Group 38

4. add series statement to catalog records where it is missing

5. add batch note about the reclass to the catalog records

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Review Record Groups to remove material that is not an official university record</span>

<b>Timeframe:</b> begin after all Dewey materials have been reclassed but not physically relocated
<ol>
	<li>Materials that should get their own collection number</li>
</ol>
ii.¬† UA materials that we should discard according to the records retention schedule

III. Rare books

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Faculty Publications</span>

<b>Timeframe:</b> withdrawal of these materials can begin once the decision is made

Alston used create lists in Millennium to export a list of all items kept in either our Faculty Publications collection or in Law‚Äôs Faculty Publications collection.¬† According to that spreadsheet, we have about 536 books in our Faculty Publications collection that are actually by Law faculty AND are also being kept in Law‚Äôs faculty publications collection.<b></b>

Alston has spoken to John Jacob and Jack Bissett about this.¬† They confirmed that they would be ok with us withdrawing these items from our collection and would take on full responsibility for collections such items from their faculty going forward.¬† It is possible there could be some other books by law professors in our collection where a second copy does not exists in Law‚Äôs collection.¬† In these cases, Law would want to acquire these copies from us.

We can use the create list to withdraw items and/or transfer items in batch

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Alumni Publications</span>

Currently investigating Law‚Äôs practices and creating a list
