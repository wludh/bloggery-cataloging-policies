<h2 style="text-align: justify" align="center">WLU Collections</h2><br /><h3 style="text-align: justify" align="center">Inventory Mss 100-</h3><br />3 Hollinger boxes<br /><p style="text-align: justify" align="center">Alston, Emily, and Byron inventoried thethree Hollinger boxes that were "Mss 100" this summer, separating apart materials into unique manuscript collections as appropriate or relocating materials into an existing collection or record group as appropriate. If item(s) was determined to be a unique manuscript collection, it was given a record in ArchivesSpace. Folders were labeled as appropriate and all of these collections were housed together in several Hollinger boxes and correctly labeled. All collection names and numbers have been recorded in this wiki under collection overview.</p><br /><p style="text-align: justify" align="center">Five items belonging to Mss. 100 had beenpreviously cataloged individually in Annie and all given the same call number. We have updated the call numbers on those records with their new collection numbers.</p><br /><p style="text-align: justify" align="center">ArchivesSpace is able to export theinformation recorded about collections as both EAD encoded finding aids and MARC XML, which can be put into Annie. At some point Mackenzie and I will export the MARC XML for the manuscript collections that had catalog records, put them into Annie to overlay the previous records. Over time, Alston and Mackenzie will generate MarcXML from the other ArchivesSpace resource records as they are finished and will load this MarcXML into Millennium to create catalog records for the other collections at least until ArchivesSpace becomes OAI compliant and Summon is then able to gather our AS records for inclusion in their knowledgebase.</p><br /><p style="text-align: justify" align="center"><strong>ABC 11/15/2016</strong>- Mackenzie and I decided not to periodically generate Marc XML from AS for the catalog (Annie) because we determined it would be too much workflow and work on us to take this on. It is however possible. Making ArchivesSpace OAI compliant was voted on in the most recent AS prioritization survey (August 2016) but I am unsure at this time how it placed in the results. All of the existing catalog records for manuscript materials have had their call numbers updated to WLU Coll. ####</p><br /><p style="text-align: justify" align="center">As of October 2016, I began exporting out EAD for WLU manuscript collections that are "finished" i.e. small collections that are sufficiently processed and will not receive further processing for a long time if ever. More detail about this is recorded for my replacement in the Transition document.</p><br /><br /><h3>Inventory W&amp;L Miscellaneous</h3><br />Lisa went through all of the boxes of "W&amp;L Misc" and separated out original materials from photocopies. For the original items, she pulled the appropriate card from the card catalog and placed it in therelated folder.<br /><br />Byron and Alston beganinventorying the original materials, incorporating the card information; 11 holinger boxes remain. They live inside the vault directly inside the front door when you turn right.<br /><br />For each folder, we assigned a collection number and relabeled each folderwith the new collection name andadded the collection number. We created a record in ArchivesSpace.<br /><br />We chose to store multiple small collections with consecutive numbering together in a single hollinger box, noting this in physical location notes. Once a box became full, we physically relabeled that box to show which collections are housed together.<br /><br />The photocopied materials will be kept together, arranged topically, for easy reference since they frequently contain biographical information.<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016-</strong> Special Collections student worker Dani Leon is going through the non-original materials mentioned above and added them to ArchivesSpace as WLU Coll. 0668 Washington and Lee University and Regional Virginia History Research Collection.<br /><h2>RHS Collections</h2><br />Byron and Alston spent some time summer 2015<b></b>beginning to inventory the RHS collections, pullingonebox at a time from the vault and taking it to Byron's workstation. We started with the RHS biography section.<br /><br />Theywentthrougheach box a folder at a time,examined the items to determineif an item orset of items should become a distinct collection, be added to an existing collection, be added to a Record Group, be cataloged for rare, or be looked at by Tom. For any item(s) determined to be a distinct collection, a resource record was createdfor that collection in ArchivesSpace and it was assigned a collection title and number.<br /><br />The presence of photocopies within a collectionwas notedin the resource records and the owner of the original item was recorded or researched if unknown.<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016-</strong> Unfortunately this effort went rather slowly probably because we started with the biography section. We added approximately 40 RHS coll records to AS as a result. Several other RHS coll records have been added since for individual collections deemed particularly important.<br /><br /><strong><span style="font-family: Thread-00001d8c-Id-00000050"></span></strong>
