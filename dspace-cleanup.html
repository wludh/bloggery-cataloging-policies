Martin P. Burks, Jr. graduated in 1905. The other photo, from 1907, shows him in full academic regalia, as though he‚Äôs faculty. This is not an undergrad commencement gown. Still, this is just a guess. (Martin P. Burks Memorial Fund is named for Martin P. Burks, Sr. -- read about him at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_P._Burks%20" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000">Wikipedia</span></a>. And then there‚Äôs an interesting note on this book: The history of memorials and tablets of Grace Memorial Church, Lexington, Virginia by Martin P. Burks.</span></li><br /></ol><br />ABC- I confirmed in the Alumni directory that Martin P. Burks Jr graduated in 1905. He did not have a card in faculty file though so I cannot confirm that he taught here. His father however does have a faculty file card because he was dean of the school of law, W&amp;L, 1903-18. I agree with you that the second picture is not of a regular undergraduate gown, so I'm now thinking that perhaps this picture really is of Martin P. Burks Sr during his time as dean. see http://law.wlu.edu/mootcourt/page.asp?pageid=1490 DONE.<br /><ol><br /> 	<li>Combine multiple image files into one record, where appropriate -- on subject in multiple poses on one date.
