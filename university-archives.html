"<h1 style="text-align: left" align="center">Project 1: Reclassing Dewey items¬†for integration¬†into Record Groups</h1><br /><b>Timeframe: </b>start¬†during Spring 2015<br /><h2>i. Cataloged Boxed publications</h2><br />46 titles<br /><br />The steps below are a generalized workflow for these publications.¬† Individual titles may need to have other actions taken.¬† The details of each title will be worked out before that title is reclassed.<br /><br />1. Alston determines which record group each Dewey title should be transferred to<br /><br />2. Tony relabels folders<br /><br />3. Tony writes new Record Group number on the items in pencil above where the Dewey number is written<br /><br />4. Tony relabels the boxes with RG # and name of publication<br /><br />5. Tony updates call number in the catalog record for each one of these publications<br /><br />6. Tony creates an item record for each box and applies a barcode to the box lid on the same end as a labels<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016-¬†</strong>completed; we did not add barcodes to most of the boxes<br /><h2>ii. Uncataloged Boxed publications</h2><br />Alston went through the boxed¬†Dewey section of the vault and took an inventory of all titles.¬† This revealed 39 boxed publications that needed cataloging, as well as a Miscellaneous box for each letter.<br /><br />1. Alston and Tony¬†are working through all of the boxed titles first.<br /><br />Tony has completed the Millenium work and physical processing of these materials.<br /><br />2. After all cataloged boxed publications have been reclassed and all non-cataloged boxed publications have been cataloged and appropriately classed, then Alston will assess all the Miscellaneous boxes.¬† Then catalog records will be created as needed and Tony will process.<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016-</strong> Done<br /><h2>iii.

For items where the barcode is attached to an acid free flag, either relabel flag in pencil OR generate new flag and give item new barcode.<br /><br />6. Physical location: I recommend we wait till all are reclassed to move them physically.¬† For some we might want to relabel ends of rows instead of moving them physically.<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016</strong>- done; all physical materials were integrated into their appropriate place in the Record Groups when the vault was reorganized summer 2016<br /><br />Sub-project: Calyx weeding<br /><br />Timeframe: summer 2015<br /><br />1. I go through the ones in the vault and uses Wendy‚Äôs documents to help me decide which copies to withdraw, leaving best condition copies on the shelf; pull volumes to be withdrawn<br /><br />2. Tom reviews my selections and adjusts as needed<br /><br />3. I also pull volumes that need to have their copy numbers updated, paper clipping a note with the NEW copy number to the flag<br /><br />4. I pass these volumes on to Tony<br /><br />5. Tony withdraws the volumes in millennium (deleting item records) and physically deprocesses them<br /><br />6. Tony notifies Alston and Mackenzie when he has completed this work; they get him started on vols that need item number updates.<br /><br />7. For those, in Millennium Tony updates their copy numbers and replaces the 082 Dewey call number in the item records with an 099 that says "Record Group 47".<br /><br />8. He can either cross through the Dewey call number and copy # on the acid free flags and write the new info<br /><br />OR he can type a new acid free flag (which will mean the item will need a new barcode).<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />9. Tony notifies Mackenzie and Alston when he has completed this work<br /><br />10. Alston brings the updated volumes back to the vault and in collaboration with spec coll staff reshelve them into a smaller area<br /><br /><strong>ABC 11/15/2016-</strong> Not done, on indefinite hold per Tom Camden. ¬†The vault space issue was main impetus and that was alleviated some due to the compact shelving installation.<br /><h2>iv.
