Theyalso provide good guidancefor allscanning activities. It is important to follow these policies because they will help ensure the authenticity, integrity, and fixity of our digital files and future of our digital collections. There may be situations where different specifications are required due to the particular characteristics of the item being digitized. Therefore, please check with Cindy Morton (<a href="mailto:mortonc@wlu.edu">mortonc@wlu.edu</a>) at the beginning of every digitization project. Tom Camden (<a href="mailto:camdent@wlu.edu">camdent@wlu.edu</a>) or Seth McCormick-Goodhart (<a href="mailto:goodharts@wlu.edu" target="_blank">goodharts@wlu.edu</a>) will judge the condition of items before scanning. Using the wrong piece of equipment to digitize a fragile item, may cause irreparable damage. Based on Tom‚s and/or Seth‚s assessment of the condition, Alston Cobourn (Seth, Byron, Tom in the interim) will decide which piece of equipment is most appropriate and safest for scanning that particular item.<br /><h3>I. Scanning Specifications</h3><br />Note: For detailedinstructions onthe scanning process, see <a href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/digitization/scanning-ingest-workflow/" target="_blank">Scanning and Ingest Workflow</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Bit depth:</strong> A bit depth of 24 is appropriate for color items. A bit depth of 8 is appropriate for grayscale items. Consider sepia toned items to be color.<br /><h4>1. Photographs</h4><br />Photographs from University Archives and our manuscript collections should be scanned as 600 dpi TIFFs. Scan photographs that are in stable condition (the base layer is strong and relatively undamaged) and with emulsions (the top layer of the photograph) thatare not flaking on the Epson 11000XL flatbed scanner at the scanning station in Special Collections. The full backlight should be covered.<br /><br />If the item lays flat on its own, you do not need to close the flatbed scanner‚s lid. If the item is only slightly folded, bent, or warped, close the lid during scanning in order to flatten the item, thus creating the best quality scan possible. If the item is severely folded, bent, or warped, consult with Seth McCormick-Goodhart or Alston's replacement before scanning the item because closing the lid onto such material could cause permanent damage.<br /><br />Photographs that are in unstable condition or have flaking emulsions should NOT be scanned in the flatbed scanner but instead using the Bookeye3 overhead scanner in Access Services. Turn off the light in the room before scanning to prevent glare.<br /><h4>2. Slides</h4><br />Slides should be scanned as 600 dpi TIFFs using the Epson 11000XL flatbed scanner with the full backlight uncovered and the scanner lid closed.Always place the slidescorrectly in the appropriately sizedholder as this willprevent damage to the slides and ensure thatthe scannercan see the items. Place thefilm tray guide bar into the slotsbeside the hinge side of the scanner bed, and square up the film tray with the notch on the left side of the guide bar before scanning.<br /><h4>3. Negatives</h4><br />Both 35mm negative strips and other larger, single negatives should be scanned as 600 dpi TIFFs using the Epson 11000XL flatbed scanner with the full backlight uncovered and the scanner lid closed.<br /><br />If there is anappropriately sizedholder, use itas this willprevent damageto the negativesand help ensure thatthe scannercan see the items. Thenplace thefilm tray guide bar into the slotson thehinge sideof the scanner bed, and square up the film tray with the notch on the left side of the guide bar before scanning.<br /><br />If wedo not have a correctly sizedholder, you may carefully scan the negatives without it. Be sure notto slide the negative around on the scanner glass. Always scan negatives with the shiny side down. Make sure to adjust the Autofocus to 0.0.<br /><h4>4. Documents and letters from manuscript collections</h4><br />Both documents and letters should be scanned in a flatbed scanner in Special Collections at 400 dpi if they are structurally sound. If the item lays flat on its own, you do not need to close the lid of the flatbed scanner during the scanning process. If the item is just slightly folded, bent, or warped, close the lid during scanning in order to flatten the item and created the best quality scan possible. If the item is severely folded, bent, or warped, consult with Seth McCormick-Goodhart or Alston's replacement before digitizing the item. Closing the lid onto such material, could cause permanent damage.<br /><br />Structurally unsound materials should be scanned on the Bookeye 3 overhead scanner at 400 dpi. Turn off the light in the room before scanning encapsulated materials to prevent glare.<br /><h4>5. Oversized materials</h4><br />If structurally sound and just slightly too large for the Epson 11000XL scanner, scan the item using the BizHub in Special Collections. Send the scan to the BizHubs folder within the Z drive Institutional Repository by pushing the Fax/Scan button, then selecting ‚ÄúGHI‚Äù from the address book, and then selecting the ‚ÄúPC (SMB) Inst. Repository‚Äù item. It is important to remember that after you have scanned the item, you must push ‚ÄúFinish‚Äù on the machine and then push the Start button again to send the file. After the scan has been sent, you will then need to find the file in the BizHubs folder, rename it, and move it to the hard drive or server folder that has been designated for the particular project.<br /><br />If the item is fragile, it should be scanned using the Bookeye3 overhead scanner at 400 dpi, which is the highest dpi available on that machine. If the material is encapsulated or photographic, turn off the light in the room to prevent glare.<br /><br />If structurally sound and larger than the capture area of the Bookeye3, we might choose on a case by case basis to enclose an item in a Mylar sleeve and scan it using the sheet-fed scanner used by the Archaeology program. This will rarely be our desired course of action. This would require special approval from Tom Camden. The dpi would vary according to the type and detail of the material being digitized.<br /><h4>6. New Text documents</h4><br />New text documents, such as Honors Theses, should be scanned at 300 dpi. If the document consists of multiple pages and is in good condition, which should typically be the case, it can be automatically fed through the top of a BizHub scanner to do this.<br />Using Adobe Acrobat Pro, save the file as a PDF/A if possible. It is the ISO-standard for digital preservation of electronic documents. This may require you to use the Preflight tool within Adobe to disable non-compliant features or correct other problems. This will be kept securely and never altered to serve as the archival record. A PDF file should also be created to be used as the access copy for patrons.<br /><h3>II. Scanning Software</h3><br />Two scanningsoftware programs are available on the scanning station computer for use in conjunction with the Epson 11000XL, SilverFast and EpsonScan. Both can recognize transparent materials that are not in holders. For detailed instructions on how to use the scanning software, see<a href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/digitization/scanning-ingest-workflow/epsonscan-instructions/" target="_blank">EpsonScan Instructions</a>.<br /><h3>III. Saving Scans</h3><br />All scans should be saved as <b>uncompressed TIFF</b> files, which will serve as the archival files. Cropping, rotating, and reversing should be done to the TIFF file <b>only</b> during the quality control checking process. Afterwards, you will derive an access filefrom the TIFF file. This will either be a <b>JPEG or PDF</b>.<br /><br />DeriveaJPEGif the original item is a photographic image or a handwritten document that will not OCR well. However, if the original item is a document containing typed text, such as a newly published university brochureoratyped letterfrom a manuscript collection, the derivative access file should be a PDF so that we can run OCR on it. PDF is a more appropriate file format for items that are more text based than image based.<br /><br />We will not add watermarks toour digitalfiles.<br /><br />&nbsp;"
