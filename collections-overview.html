Archival Collections</h1><br />Materials created or received by a person, family, or organization, public or<br />private, in the conduct of their affairs that are preserved because of the<br />enduring value contained in the information they contain or as evidence of the<br />functions and responsibilities of their creator.<br /><h2>a. Washington and Lee University Manuscript Collections</h2><br />The manuscript collections owned by W&amp;L.¬† <a title="WLU Manuscript Collections" href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/digitization-2/current-projects/overview/wlu-manuscript-collections/">See a list of all the WLU collections</a><br /><br /><b>Per Alston and Tom 02/2014- </b><br /><br />No more materials will be added to Coll. 0100 (previously known as Mss. 100).¬† Instead each group of new materials will be assigned its own Coll. # and be added as a unique unit, even if it is a single item.¬† We are currently¬†planning a project¬†to have Emily Crawford focus on separating Coll. 0100 into¬†distinct collections during summer 2014.<br /><br /><strong>Alston 08/11/2015- </strong>During summer 2014 WLU Coll. 0100 was separated into distinct collections and records added to ArchivesSpace.¬† Also, the items in the Secure Cabinet were inventoried<br /><br /><strong>Alston 11/10/2016-</strong> Most of "W&amp;L misc" has been dealt with (cataloged as manuscript or photographic collections, sent to University Archives, cataloged as a rare book) as appropriate. ¬†Beginning fall 2016, Special Collections student worker Dani Leon began inputting information about the part of "W&amp;L misc" that were essentially "subject files" (ie printed materials and photocopies of materials in other archival repositories about places or people organized by place or person) into ArchivesSpace as WLU Coll 0668 Washington and Lee University and Regional Virginia History Research Collection.<br /><br /><strong>Alston 11/10/2016</strong>- as I have been exporting EAD from ArchivesSpace for WLU Colls and putting it in the Virginia Heritage Project, I have been marking the Finding Aid Status as Completed in the Finding Aid Data section.<br /><h2>b. Washington and Lee University Photographic and Print Collections</h2><br />The collections owned by W&amp;L that contain purely photographic or print materials.¬† See a list of all the <a title="WLU Photographs and Prints Collections" href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/collections-overview/wlu-photographs-and-prints-collections/">WLU Photographic and Print Collections</a><br /><br /><strong>Alston 08/11/2015-</strong><br /><br />Summer 2015 student intern Bailey Russell worked with Seth Goodhart to inventory many of the photographic materials that had been previously housed in Record Group 41.¬† This collection is not yet complete.¬† We plan to have a student worker continue this in the fall.<br /><br /><strong>Alston 11/10/2016-¬†</strong>Elizabeth Wolfe did some work on this by creating accession records. ¬†Ultimately the project is halted as Seth needs to review those accession records. ¬†During the summer 2016 vault reorganization, materials destined for this category were moved from the compact shelving to the filing cabinet area on the front wall of the vault so all of these materials should now be together except for some random scrapbooks that are still mixed in with the W&amp;L news office scrapbooks in Record Group 22.<br /><h2>c. Rockbridge Historical Society</h2><br />The archival collections owned by Rockbridge Historical Society that remain on long-term deposit at WLU.¬† These collections contain materials in various formats.¬† <a title="Rockbridge Historical Society Archival Collections" href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/collections-overview/rockbridge-historical-society/" target="_blank">See a list of all RHS archival collections</a><br /><br /><strong>Alston 08/11/2015-</strong> Very little RHS material has a been assigned a collection identifier or had a record created in ArchivesSpace. ¬†summer 2015 Byron and I began going through the RHS biography section of RHS coll and cataloging materials as individual RHS colls as appropriate.<br /><br /><strong>Alston 11/11/2016-</strong> RHS volunteers Dennis Wood and his wife are currently creating scope notes, identifying subjects and agents for some RHS collections.<br /><h1>II. University Archives</h1><br />University Archives contains records created by Washington and Lee University or members of its community (students, faculty, and staff)¬†during the course of university business.<br /><br /><strong>a. Dewey</strong><br /><br />All titles currently classed as Dewey are in the process of being reclassed and integrated into the appropriate Record Group.¬† All Dewey items reclassed for Record Groups 1-31 and 33-37 are being placed with the rest of the materials for that record group.¬† All items reclassed for Record Group 32 and 38-47 are being temporarily put back where the Dewey publications have been stored because there is a lack of shelf space in their appropriate record group locations. ¬†Some materials that have been reclassed for RG 3 are also being put back in this location because of a lack of shelf space. ¬†<a title="Dewey items being reclassed for Record Groups" href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/collections-overview/dewey-items-being-reclassed-for-record-groups/">See a list of these titles and their current locations</a><br /><br /><strong>Alston 2/2/2016-</strong> all Dewey publications have been reclassed for Record Groups or cataloged for Rare EXCEPT for the Calyx, which will be weeded Date TBD and then reclassed.<br /><br /><strong>11/11/2016-</strong> During the summer 2016 vault reorganization (due to installation of a second range of compact shelving) these newly reclassed RG items were integrated into the established Record Group area so that all materials are arranged chronologically by # EXCEPT for RG43 Provosts, which is still located in its original location by RG3 (since it was previously RG3A). ¬†This was an oversight during the shifting.<br /><br /><strong>what stage is the vault reorg at?</strong><br /><br /><strong>b. Record Groups</strong><br /><br /><a title="List of Record Groups" href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/policies/record-groups/list-of-record-groups/">See a¬†list of all the Record Groups</a><br /><br />Only items created during the course of university business¬†should be added to the University Archives Record Groups. ¬†Materials ABOUT W&amp;L but not created by W&amp;L faculty, staff, or students, should not be added to the RGs.<br /><br /><strong>per Tom and Alston, 7/7/2015</strong>- ¬† As Alston went¬†through the Dewey boxes labeled by letter, she discovered items from several organizations for which there was no record group: Hillel, Tucker Multimedia Center, and the Writing Program. ¬†The Record Groups that were created based on format (Record Group 41- Photographs, Record Group 42- Films and Videotapes, and Record Group 43- Sound Recordings, and¬†Record Group 44- Plans, Drawings and Maps) will be kept together in these format areas but they will no longer be called Record Groups.¬† Next summer when the new compact shelving arrives, we will arrange the materials within these format areas according to how they fit into the other Record Groups by issuing body.¬† Until then, they will remain exactly as they have been, the only change being that instead of referring to those sections by their RG #, we should start getting used to calling them the Sound Recordings section or the Films and Videotapes section.¬† The RG #s previously assigned to these format sections (41, 42, 43, and 44) will be used for the newly established RGs.¬† The TMC will be RG40, Writing Program will be RG41, Hillel will be RG 42.<br /><br /><strong>Alston 11/11/2016</strong>- several new RGs have been established since. ¬†They are reflected on the linked list above. ¬†ArchivesSpace contains a shell record for each record group.<br /><br />A few have a had <em>all</em> of their collection components added:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>RG6- Treasurer</li><br /> 	<li>RG23- Facilities Management</li><br /> 	<li>RG25- Dining Services</li><br /> 	<li>RG41- Writing Program</li><br /> 	<li>RG7- Provosts</li><br /> 	<li>RG42- Hillel</li><br /> 	<li>RG26- Bookstore</li><br /> 	<li>RG14- Student Health Services</li><br /> 	<li>RG17- Housing</li><br /> 	<li>RG3- Presidents</li><br /> 	<li>RG5- Dean of Students</li><br /></ul><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />A few have had a few collection components added as dewey materials were reclassed and added to the RGs:<br /><ul><br /> 	<li>RG44- Office of Public Safety</li><br /> 	<li>RG40- Tucker Multimedia Center</li><br /> 	<li>RG45-Center for Global Learning and Office of International Education</li><br /> 	<li>RG37-News Office</li><br /> 	<li>RG22- Communications and Publications</li><br /> 	<li>RG21- Human Resources</li><br /> 	<li>RG47- University Publications</li><br /> 	<li>RG29- Shenandoah</li><br /> 	<li>RG31-Special Events</li><br /> 	<li>RG13- University Library</li><br /> 	<li>RG27- Capital Planning</li><br /> 	<li>RG32- Alumni Office</li><br /> 	<li>RG11- Registrar</li><br /> 	<li>RG15- Counseling Services</li><br /> 	<li>RG34- UCAH</li><br /> 	<li>RG2- Board of Trustees</li><br /> 	<li>RG7- Commerce, Econ, Politics</li><br /> 	<li>RG4- VP for Academic Affairs/Dean of the College</li><br /> 	<li>RG8- Dean of the School of Law</li><br /> 	<li>RG9- Departments</li><br /> 	<li>RG10-Admissions</li><br /> 	<li>RG39- University Orgs and Societies</li><br /> 	<li>RG38- Student Projects</li><br /></ul><br /><strong>¬†c.
