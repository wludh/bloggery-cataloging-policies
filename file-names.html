<h3>1. Basic Construction</h3><br />Digital files that are part of our collection (either those created through digitization of our physical collection or born-digital items added to our collection) should be named according to the following pattern:<br />Collection ID_Series_Item#<br /><br /><strong>Collection ID</strong>: Consists of three parts. See the <a href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/special-collections/policies/accession-and-collection-names/" target="_blank">Accession &amp; Collection IDs </a>pagefor further instructions.<br /><br /><strong>Series:</strong>Record the name of theseries (or keyword for) within the larger collection to which it belongs if applicable.<br /><br /><strong>Item #:</strong> Each item in a collection should have its own four digit item number.<br /><br />For some kinds of materials, such as honors theses, other information may be included, such as author last name and year of creation.<br /><h3>2. Fronts and Backs of Items</h3><br />I. If you are digitizing a photograph with writing onits backside, make a second scan of the back as well. Both scans will have the same item number. For the scan of the <span style="color: #ff0000">front</span> side, add <span style="color: #ff0000">_f</span> onto end ofthe file name. For the scan of the<span style="color: #ff0000">back</span> side, add <span style="color: #ff0000">_b</span> onto the end of the file name.<br /><br />II. If you are digitizing a multipage document from a collection, digitize each page separately. Then structure the base file name as stated above. Each scan will have the same item number. Then add _#f or _#b as needed to the end of the file names. The # should reflect the page number of the original document, and the f and b should represent front or back of that particular page.<br /><br />III. If you are digitizing a multipage document that is folded oddly, such as in Diagram A below, f and b might not be useful ways of reflecting how the scans relate to each other. In such cases, instead append _# to the end of the file names to reflect which page the scan represents within the original item.<br /><br /><a href="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/sites/40/2014/02/foldeddocumentdiagram1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://bloggery.wlu.edu/cataloging-policies/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/sites/40/2014/02/foldeddocumentdiagram1.png" alt="foldeddocumentdiagram" width="768" height="614" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br /><br />The item shown in Diagram A is a letter from the James McDowell Collection (WLU Coll. 0045). This collection only contains three items in a single series. Scanning this item results in the creation of three tiff files.<br /><h2>3. General Best Practices for All File Names</h2><br />One easy way to help ensure the longevity of all the files you create in your daily workis to avoid using spaces and symbols in your file names. Try using an underscore (_) instead of a space or capitalizing new words to enhance readability instead of using spaces.<br /><h3>4.
