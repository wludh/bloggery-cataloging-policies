Finding aids are inventories, indexes, or guides that are created by archival and manuscript repositories to provide information about specific collections. While the finding aids may vary somewhat in style, their common purpose is to provide detailed description of the content and intellectual organization of collections of archival materials. EAD allows the standardization of collection information in finding aids within and across repositories.</blockquote><br /><a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/eadabout.html">From About EAD</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/">EAD site from Library of Congress</a>"
