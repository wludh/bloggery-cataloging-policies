"1. We should create an accession record in ArchivesSpace for anything we choose to add to our permanent collection.<br /><br />2. Cindy/Alston's replacement will take responsibility for adding accession records into ArchivesSpace when digital files are added to the collection if the items are their own collection. If they are part of another collection, this person will make sure they are reflected in the appropriate accession record."
